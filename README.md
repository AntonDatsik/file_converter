# file_converter

Django application for converting html links and files to PDF format.


### Notes

Uses Swagger as tool for documentation.

**BUT**. It's better to use Postman for sending files. (No opportunity to attach file through Swagger).


### Docker

Docker can be used only for development purposes.

Build an image from a Dockerfile:
`docker build . -t file_converter:latest`

Start containers:
`docker-compose up`
